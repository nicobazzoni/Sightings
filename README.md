# Sightings 
Greetings earthling! Sightings is CLI that displays 20 different historical UFO sightings. The information is scraped from the MUFON website.
After typing in their name, users can choose from an ennumerated menu by typing in a corresponding number in the command line.  Since the details of each sighting event are lengthy, "Sightings" only displays an introduction to each event but a user can click the url after the elipses that redirects them to the MUFON website for further reading. After a user is done reading about UFO events, the user is prompted by an alien to help him get back to his planet!  Enjoy!

# Instructions
To run Sightings type ``` ruby bin/run.rb``` in your command line.
